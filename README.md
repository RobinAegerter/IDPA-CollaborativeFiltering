# Collaborative Filtering
With this project we calculate the expected rating of a movie depending on its preferences and ratings with the help of the cosine similarity.

## Prerequisits

* Installed python3
* Installed pip3
* Data (you can find a set of example deta in ratings.csv)

To use the python script you need to install some packages which can be installed from the requirements.txt file with the following command:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

_Please note that you need to be in the project directory._


## How to use the script

The script which should be run is the idpa.py file. To execute and calculate the ratings you need to run the following command:

```python idpa.py```


If you want to play around with the neighbourhood, please consider changing the variable NEIGHBORHOOD to a desired numeric value in idpa.py on line 6.
